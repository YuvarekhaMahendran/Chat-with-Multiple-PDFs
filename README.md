•	Collaborated with 3 members and designed a Multi-PDF Chatbot Application by feeding PDF as inputs leveraging Lang Chain, FAISS, and Stream lit; allowed interactive document query and retrieval system with OpenAI embeddings for semantic understanding.

•	Preprocessed and split documents into chunks of 1000 characters with a 200-character overlap, creating optimized text embeddings.

•	Designed a Conversational Retrieval System with memory to handle Multiple PDFs so responses are efficient and context-aware to user queries.
